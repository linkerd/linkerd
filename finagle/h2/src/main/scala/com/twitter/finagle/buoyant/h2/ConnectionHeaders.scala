/**
 * Detect connection-headers in accordance with RFC 7540 ยง8.1.2.2:
 *
 *     HTTP/2 does not use the Connection header field to indicate
 *     connection-specific header fields; in this protocol,
 *     connection-specific metadata is conveyed by other means. An
 *     endpoint MUST NOT generate an HTTP/2 message containing
 *     connection-specific header fields; any message containing
 *     connection-specific header fields MUST be treated as malformed
 *     (Section 8.1.2.6).
 *
 *     The only exception to this is the TE header field, which MAY be
 *     present in an HTTP/2 request; when it is, it MUST NOT contain
 *     any value other than "trailers".
 *
 *     This means that an intermediary transforming an HTTP/1.x
 *     message to HTTP/2 will need to remove any header fields
 *     nominated by the Connection header field, along with the
 *     Connection header field itself. Such intermediaries SHOULD also
 *     remove other connection-specific header fields, such as
 *     Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, Transfer-Encoding, and Upgrade,
 *     even if they are not nominated by the Connection header field.
