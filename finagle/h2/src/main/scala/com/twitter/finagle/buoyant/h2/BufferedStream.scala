/**
 * A BufferedStream reads Frames from an underlying Stream and stores them in a buffer.
 * BufferedStream itself is not a Stream but child Streams can be created from it by calling
 * fork().  Child Streams will first be offered all of the buffered Frames and then all Frames
 * read from the underlying Stream will also offered to the child Streams.
 *
 * When the buffer becomes full or when discardBuffer() is called, the buffer will be discarded
 * and no new child Streams may be created.  However, child Streams that had previously been
 * created will continue to receive Frames as they are read from the underlying Stream.
 *
 * The Frames that are stored in the buffer and offered to the child Streams are refcounted and
 * the underlying Frame will only be released once each child Stream releases the Frame and the
 * buffer itself releases the Frame.  Threrefore you should always call discardBuffer on a
 * BufferedStream before it leaves scope.
