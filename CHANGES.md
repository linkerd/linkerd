## x.x.x

* New default JVM settings scale up with traffic levels.
  * `JVM_HEAP` is now deprecated, you can now separately set `JVM_HEAP_MIN` and
    `JVM_HEAP_MAX` but you shouldn't need to adjust them thanks to the new defaults.
* Overhaul HTTP headers:
  * `l5d-ctx` renamed to `l5d-ctx-trace`
  * `l5d-ctx-deadline` now propagates deadlines
  * `l5d-ctx-dtab` is now read, to replace `dtab-local` later.
  * `l5d-dtab` now honored as a replacement for `dtab-local` as
    specified by users.
  * `l5d-dst-*` no longer set on responses
* Fix graceful connection teardown on streaming HTTP responses #482.
* linkerd routers' `timeoutMs` configuration now applies on the
  server-side, so that the timeout acts as a global timeout rather
  than an individual request timeout.
  * Added server `timeoutMs` configuration, which controls global
    timeout.
  * Added client `timeoutMs` configuration, which controls individual
    request timeout.

## 0.6.0

* Add zkLeader namer to allow discovery of services through ZooKeeper leader
  election.
* Add HTTP path request identifier, which builds destinations from a
  configurable number of HTTP URI path segments.
* **Breaking Change!** The path prefix `/#` now indicates that the path should
  be processed by a namer.  A namer matches a path starting with `/#/<prefix>`.
* **Breaking Change!** Rename many plugin kind names.
* **Breaking Change!** Experimental plugins now require the `experimental: true`
  property to be set.
* **Breaking Change!** Change the format for ZooKeeper hosts in the ZK storage
  config.

## 0.5.0

  time to spend binding a path.

  rather than thrift-encoded.
* Add `/api/1/bind`, `/api/1/addr`, and `/api/1/delegate` HTTP APIs to namerd
  * Most HTTP APIs now support `?watch=true` for returning updates via a
    streaming response.
* Add ACL and authentication support to the ZooKeeper DtabStore.
* Support wildcards in dtabs!
* New linkerd dashboard is now enabled by default!! :chart_with_upwards_trend:

  `identifier` header (see linkerd/docs/config.md for add'l info)

  timeout against the marathon API.
* Add a `enableProbation` config option for configuring a client's load balancer
  probation setting

## 0.2.1

  we don't provide any out of the box just yet)
* `namers` configurations may now configure Namers or NameInterpreters
  to support richer namer behavior.

  specified and configured.  The load balancers that are currently supported are
  p2c, ewma, aperture, and heap.
* Add a config.json admin endpoint which re-serializes the parsed linkerd config.
* Add a `maxConcurrentRequests` config option to limit number of concurrent
  requests accepted by a server.
* Add a `hostConnectionPool` client config section to control the number of
  connections maintained to destination hosts.
* Add a `attemptTTwitterUpgrade` thrift client config option to control whether
  thrift protocol upgrade should be attempted.

## 0.2.0

* This release contains **breaking changes** to the configuration file format.
  linkerd config files are now a bit more explicit and less "magical",
  in the following ways:
  * Router configuration options can no longer be specified globally at the
    root level of the config file, but must be specified per-router.
  * All routers must now include a `servers` section; previously, a default
    server port would be used if none was provided.

  specified. We currently support `binary` (default) and `compact`.
* Added traffic routing support for marathon apps with slashes in
  their ids.
* Resolved a browser-compatibility issue in the admin page for those not
  using the latest-and-greatest Chrome/Firefox/Safari.

* TLS, for real this time.
* Configuration updates: config now includes a client section, where you can
  configure client-specific parameters.

## 0.0.10

* We now support end-to-end TLS! However, verification is currently limited to
  global certs. See  https://github.com/BuoyantIO/linkerd/issues/64 for more on
  the upcoming roadmap.
* Prep work for "transparent TLS". Look for this in upcoming releases.
* Prep work for being able to generate Docker images from the repo, in service
  of a glorious containerized future.

## 0.0.8

* Big new feature alert! We now have Zookeeper ServerSet support.
* Server-side TLS support! Stay tuned for more security features coming in
  future releases...

  receive your honorable pull requests!

## 0.0.7

This is a big release! Get ready.

* Brand new name: :sunrise: linkerd :balloon:
* We're open source! This release is under Apache License v2.
* Tons of documentation on https://linkerd.io!
* This release adds config file support! You can express all your routing,
  listening, and protocol configuration needs in one convenient YAML file! See
  docs for how this works.

## 0.0.6

* Admin UI now features 25% more amazingness. :rainbow:
* Preliminary "pure" thrift support.
  * Default is framed transport with binary encoding; buffered transport also
    supported.
  * Out of the box, the router is configured to listen for thrift on port 4141
    (i.e. in addition to HTTP on port 4140), and forwards thrift calls to
    localhost:9998. This will almost definitely change in the future.
* Tons of performance tuning. We're benchmarking sub-1ms p99 request latency and
  40k+ qps throughput. Working on memory footprint reduction next.
* By popular demand, HTTP response code stats are now exported in metrics.json.
* Configurability still limited to what you can change in config.sh and disco/.
  Expect improvements here soon.

  * Allow internal and external http service prefixes to be specified on the
    command-line

## 0.0.2

* Router start/stop commands now detect if the router is currently running,
  easily preventing a whole class of easily-preventable errors.
* Tarball permissions are fixed.
* New support for Consul-backed service discovery, if files aren't good enough
  for ya.

## 0.0.1

First release of the Buoyant Application Router.
