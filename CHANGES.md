## 1.7.3 2020-05-19
Linkerd 1.7.3 is a maintenance release that upgrades finagle to 20.4.1 and
netty to 4.1.47-Final. The node and eslint dependencies required by the Admin
UI are also upgraded to 14.2.0 and 6.8.0, respectively. 

* Upgrade to finagle 20.4.1 and Netty 4.1.47-Final [#2386](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2386)
* Upgrade to Node 14.2.0 and eslint 6.8.0 [#2389](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2389)

## 1.7.2 2020-03-30
Linkerd 1.7.2 is a point release which addresses gRPC responses which have no
bodies, but do have trailers. With this change in place, Linkerd will 
return a failed Future containing a Non-Ok GrpcStatus instance when handling
empty gRPC responses with EOS trailers.

* gRPC
  * Fix grpc handling of trailers-only h2 responses [#2379](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2379)

Our gratitude goes out to [jlawrienyt](https://github.com/jlawrienyt) for 
finding and fixing this issue.

## 1.7.1 2019-12-18
Linkerd 1.7.1 adds a parameter named `initialStreamWindowSizeKB` to 
MeshInterpreterInitializer.scala. This parameter is used to configure the 
[initial flow-control window size](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#InitialWindowSize)
that the H2 client in the `io.l5d.mesh` interpreter sends to the H2 server. 

Parameter Name | Default Value | Description
-----------------|---------------|-------------
`initialStreamWindowSizeKB` | 1024 (1 MB) | Sets the [initial flow-control window size](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#InitialWindowSize) for the H2 client used by the intepreter

This release is brought to you with fixes from these contributors. Thank you 
all SO much for being a part of the community!
[Robert Panzer](https://github.com/robertpanzer)
[Robert Macaulay](https://github.com/taer)

Full release notes:
* HTTP/1.1
  * Adds configuration server.serverSession to allow expiring server connections [#2353](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2353)
  * Ensures that the `streamingEnabled` router parameter is handled properly [#2332](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2332)
* HTTP/2
  * Adds functionality to respect `maxConcurrentStreams` for server dispatchers [#2327](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2327)  
* Linkerd Mesh Interpreter
  * Add the `initialStreamWindowSizeKB` parameter to the `io.l5d.mesh` interpreter. [#2364](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2364)
  
## 1.7.0 2019-08-27
Linkerd 1.7.0 includes a number of memory leak fixes for Linkerd and its
underlying `grpc-runtime` module. This release includes improvements for
SNI-enabled TLS communication, support for streaming arbitrarily large HTTP
requests and responses in HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 as well an upgraded JDK for
improved Docker container support.

A special thank you to [Fantayeneh](https://github.com/fantayeneh) for their
awesome work on [#2315](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2315)

Full release notes:
* **Breaking Change**
  * Removes `maxRequestKB` and `maxResponseKB` from Linkerd's configuration
    options in favor of `streamAfterContentLengthKB`. These parameters were
    primarily intended to limit the amount of memory Linkerd used when buffering
    requests. The streamAfterContentLengthKB parameter achieves this more
    efficiently by streaming large messages instead of buffering them.

* Consul
  * Enables streaming in the HTTP client used in the `io.l5d.consul` namer
    to allow for arbitrarily large responses from Consul
  * Support for the inclusion of Consul response service and node metadata
    in Namerd 'io.l5d.mesh and 'io.l5d.httpController' responses.
* Linkerd Configuration
  * Introduces a router parameter called `maxCallDepth` that prevents unbounded
    cyclic proxy request routing
  * Adds support for limiting the maximum size of `l5d-err` header values by
    using `maxErrResponseKB` in an HTTP router
  * Fixes an issue were some `socketOptions` were being ignored when partially
    configured
* TLS
  * Fixes an issue where Linkerd can't connect to SNI servers that are addressed
    via IPv4 and IPv6
* HTTP/2
  * Fixes a number of direct and heap memory leaks in Linkerd's HTTP/2 module
  * Fixes an issue causing users of `grpc-runtime` module to experience direct
    memory leaks
* Updates Linkerd's JDK version for improved container support

## 1.6.4 2019-07-01
Linkerd 1.6.4 updates the finagle version to 19.5.1 and adds support for
configuring message response sizes from when using consul.  
              
ConsulInitializer.scala now includes the parameters below which are used 
to configure the Http.client object that is instantiated in the `newNamer` 
method.
              
Parameter Name | Default Value | Description
-----------------|---------------|-------------
`maxHeadersKB` | 8 | The maximum size of all headers in an HTTP message created by the Consul client
`maxInitialLineKB` | 4 | The maximum size of an initial HTTP message line created by the Consul client
`maxRequestKB` | 5120 | The maximum size of a non-chunked HTTP request payload sent by the Consul client
`maxResponseKB` | 5120 | The maximum size of a non-chunked HTTP response payload received by the Consul client
              
Full release notes:
* Upgrade to finagle 19.5.1 [#2284](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2284)
* Support configurable response body sizes from consul [#2286](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/issues/2286) 
* Log inbound requests to namerd [#2275](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/2275) 

## 1.6.3 2019-05-10
Linkerd 1.6.3 includes a bug fix for Namerd's `io.l5d.k8s` dtab storage module. This fix exposes
HTTP request and response metrics for the Kubernetes API client used to store dtabs. Namerd also
includes a new logging dashboard page that allows you to change Namerd's logging verbosity at
runtime. In addition, this release improves Linkerd's HTTP/2 implementation to better manage direct
memory and includes a fix for Linkerd's `interpreter_state` watch state endpoint.

A special thank you to the following contributors for their awesome doc update contributions:
* [Nguyen Hai Truong](https://github.com/truongnh1992)
* [Peter Fr√∂hlich](https://github.com/peterfroehlich)

Full release notes:
* Namerd
  * Expose HTTP client metrics for Namerd's `io.l5d.k8s` dtab storage module. This change now
    instruments the HTTP client that interacts with the Kubernetes API used for storing dtabs.
  * Adds a new logging dashboard page in Namerd with the ability to change logging verbosity at
    runtime. This is similar to Linkerd's logging dashboard page
* HTTP/2
  * Fixes an issue where Linkerd could sometimes exhaust direct memory when routing HTTP/2 requests
  that immediately receive a `RST_STREAM` frame.
* Fixes a `BufferUnderflowException` that could be triggered when viewing Linkerd's
  interpreter watch state endpoint. This issue occurs when using Linkerd's `io.l5d.namerd` thrift
  interpreter.
* Fixes an issue where Linkerd incorrectly uses the JVM's Parallel GC collector if the `GC_LOG`
  start-up flag is not set on JVMs using Java 1.8 or earlier.

## 1.6.2 2019-03-08
This Linkerd release includes bug fixes for Namerd's k8s watch API as well as memory management
improvements in the `io.l5d.zk` storage plugin. This release features a new failure detector
module in the `io.l5d.mesh` interpreter that sends "heartbeat" pings on all HTTP/2 connections to
Namerd. This is intended to monitor the health of connections between Linkerd and Namerd so that
connections are torn down and re-established if a ping message is not received within a configured
amount of time.

This release also includes doc updates from the following contributors:
* [LongKB](https://github.com/longkb)
* [Nguyen Phuong An](https://github.com/annp1987)
* [JoeWrightss](https://github.com/JoeWrightss)
* [tuanvcw](https://github.com/tuanvcw)
* [Nguyen Hai Truong](https://github.com/truongnh1992)

A big shoutout to all contributors listed above for their great work!

Full release notes:

* OpenJ9
  * Fixes an issue in Linkerd's OpenJ9 docker image where Linkerd may sometimes run into an
  `OutOfMemoryErrorException` caused by OpenJ9's JDK base image
* Namerd
  * Fixes a memory leak in the `io.l5d.zk` dtab storage module
  * Fixes an issue where Namerd stops watching dtabs if it receives HTTP 404 from a Kubernetes
  API server while restarting a watch API request
* Linkerd Mesh Interpreter
  * Adds a failure detector in the `io.l5d.mesh` interpreter to help monitor the health of
  connections to Namerd. The failure detector can be configured by providing a `minPeriodMs`
  which sets the duration between each successive ping and a `closeTimeoutMs` parameter that
  sets a duration that must elapse before a connection is marked as "unhealthy"
* Adds support for configuring `socketOptions` in the client section of a Linkerd config

## 1.6.1 2019-02-01

The first 1.x release of the year brings minor bug fixes to Namerd, the `io.l5d.consul` and 
`io.l5d.curator` namers. This release features contributions from [NCBI](https://github.com/ncbi)
and ThreeComma. A big thank you to [edio](https://github.com/edio) and 
[Chris Goffinet](https://github.com/chrisgoffinet) for their contributions in this release.

Full release notes:

* Improves the `io.l5d.consul` namer's error handling in cases were it receives intermittent 5xx 
HTTP errors from Consul
* Fixes a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` that would sometimes occur when using the `io.l5d.curator` 
namer
* Fixes a `NullPointerException` that would occur when using the `io.l5d.mesh` interface in Namerd
* Adds a new configuration option called `backlog` to `socketOptions` that allows you to set up a
backlog queue size for TCP connections
* Fixes an issue where the `interpreter_state` watch endpoint would sometimes display incorrect
IP addresses

## 1.6.0 2018-12-20

Linkerd 1.6.0 includes a Finagle upgrade that reduces direct memory allocation and adds support for
more efficient HTTP/1.1 streaming for large HTTP requests. This release also improves Linkerd's 
execution script to run with Java 9 and higher. Finally, this release adds a new gRPC 
response-classifier that may be configured with user defined gRPC status codes.

Full release notes:


* **Breaking Change**
  * `requestAuthorizers` are now configured in the client section of a router configuration.
  * `maxChunkKB` has been removed and is no longer configurable for HTTP/1.1 routers. Rather than
   enforcing a hard size limit, Linkerd now streams HTTP/1.1 chunked messages that exceed 
  `streamAfterContentLengthKB`
  
HTTP/1.1
  * Adds a new config option `streamAfterContentLengthKB` that sets a threshold at which HTTP
  messages will be streamed instead of being fully buffered in memory, even when chunked-encoding is
  not used.
* Consul  
  * Fixes an issue where the last known good state of an `io.l5d.consul` namer would be cleared if 
  a 5xx API response was received from Consul.
* gRPC
  * Adds support for all `io.l5d.h2.grpc.*` response classifiers to classify gRPC status codes as 
  `Success` based off of a user defined list within the response classification section of a config.
* Fixes a startup issue where Linkerd would fail to load `readTimeoutMs` and `writeTimeoutMs`values
  from socket option configs.  
* Fixes Linkerd's executable script to work with Java version 9 and higher.
* Upgrades Finagle to 18.12.0 which reduces the amount of direct memory Linkerd allocates at startup
 time.
    
## 1.5.2 2018-11-19

Linkerd 1.5.2 adds performance improvements to HTTP/2, dramatically improving throughput when
sending many small frames as is common when using unary gRPC methods.  It also fixes a long standing
race condition where Linkerd could get stuck using out of date endpoint data from the Kubernetes
API.

Full release notes:

* HTTP/2
  * Adds buffering to the channel transport which improves throughput by up to 30% when sending many small messages.
* HTTP
  * Removes an incorrect log line about the Content-Length header when receiving a 204 response.
* Kubernetes
  * Fixes a race condition where Kubernetes endpoint sets could get stuck indefinitely with stale data.
* Prometheus
  * Moves exception names out of the metric names and into an `exception` label.
* Adds the `keepAlive` property in the server socket options config.  This allows you to enable the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option which removes dead connections that did not close properly and can therefore help prevent connection leaks. Big thanks to [Jonathan Reichhold](https://github.com/jreichhold) for this!

## 1.5.1 2018-10-24

Linkerd 1.5.1 adds a new `io.l5d.consul.interpreter` that allows Linkerd to read dtabs directly from 
a Consul KV store agent instead of using Namerd. In addition, this release fixes an issue in 
the HTTP/2 router where Linkerd would get stuck handling connections in certain cases.

This release features contributions from OfferUp, Planet Labs and Buoyant with a special shoutout
to [Leo Liang](https://github.com/leozc) and [Chris Taylor](https://github.com/ccmtaylor) for their
work on fixing a bug in the DNS SRV namer.

Full release notes:

* HTTP/2
  * Fixes an HTTP/2 issue that causes Linkerd to stop processing incoming frames on an HTTP/2
  connection after Linkerd sends a `RST_STREAM` frame to its remote peer. This was causing gRPC 
  clients to experience timeout errors intermittently because connections between Linkerd and its
  remote peers weren't being closed properly.
  * Sets the `maxConcurrentStreamsPerConnection` config value for the `h2` router to `1000` by default
  to prevent Linkerd from running out of memory when HTTP/2 clients leak connection streams.
* Consul
  * Adds a request timeout to `io.l5d.consul` namer HTTP polling requests to prevent an issue where
  the namer holds on to stale service discovery information.
  * Adds a new `io.l5d.consul.interpreter` that allows Linkerd to read dtabs directly from a Consul
  KV store.
* DNS SRV
  * Fixes an issue where the `io.l5d.dnssrv` namer would get into a bad state and fail to resolve
  service names.
* Adds support for configuring JVM GC logging in Linkerd and Namerd by default.
* Fixes a memory leak issue caused by Finagle's `BalancerRegistry` failing to properly remove
 `Balancer` objects.

## 1.5.0 2018-10-02

Linkerd 1.5.0 adds the long awaited ability to make Linkerd config changes with
zero downtime! ü§Ø This release adds the `socketOptions.reusePort` config property which allows
multiple processes to bind to the same port.  In this way, you can start a new Linkerd process
and wait for it to start serving requests before gracefully shutting down the old Linkerd process.
Note that this feature is only available on Linux 3.9 distributions and newer.

This release features contributions from [Applause](https://github.com/ApplauseAQI), ThreeComma,
GuteFrage GmbH, and [Buoyant](https://github.com/buoyantio).  An extra special thank you to
[Zack Angelo](https://github.com/zackangelo) for laying the groundwork in Finagle for the reusePort
feature!

Full release notes:

* **Breaking Change**: The `threshold` and `windowSize` options have been removed from the `failureThreshold` config in the Namerd interpreter.  These options were of limited value and are no longer supported by Finagle.
* Socket Options:
  * Certain socket options may now be set on Linkerd servers by adding a `socketOptions` config in a server config.
  * Add support for the `SO_REUSEPORT` socket option.  This allows multiple processes to bind to the same port and is a great way to do zero downtime Linkerd deploys.
* Istio features are now marked as deprecated.
* Marathon:
  * Ensure traffic is not sent to Marathon services during their health-check grace period.
* Use AsyncAppender for console logging so that logging does not impact Linkerd performance.
* Upgrade to Finagle 18.9.1

## 1.4.6 2018-08-13

Linkerd 1.4.6 adds even more watch state endpoints to Linkerd's debugging arsenal, allowing you to 
inspect the state of Linkerd‚Äôs watches easily. This release adds watch state endpoints for the 
Kubernetes ConfigMap interpreter as well as the Marathon and filesystem namers.

Full release notes:

* HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
  * Allow HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 POST requests to be retryable.
  * Fix an issue where the `x-forwarded-client-cert` header was not always cleared on incoming
    requests.
* Add TLS support for the `io.l5d.etcd` namer client.
* Admin
  * Add new `io.l5d.marathon`, `io.l5d.fs`, and `io.l5d.k8s.configMap` watch state endpoints to 
  allow diagnosis of Linkerd‚Äôs various watches.
* Distributed Tracing
  * Add a new `io.l5d.zipkin` trace propagation plugin that writes Zipkin B3 trace headers to
  outgoing requests. Previously, Zipkin trace headers were ignored by Linkerd in order for Linkerd 
  to not interfere with other tracing systems like Zipkin.
* Namerd
  * Add an experimental `io.l5d.destination` interface which implements the Linkerd 
  [destination API.](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy-api/blob/master/proto/destination.proto)

## 1.4.5 2018-07-13

Linkerd 1.4.5 contains some minor bugfixes and introduces two much-requested features. First, it is
now possible to selectively disable Linkerd's admin endpoints, e.g., keep the UI functional but to
disable the shutdown endpoint. A huge thanks to [Robert Panzer](https://github.com/robertpanzer) for
all his hard work on this.

Second, we've added experimental support for the [OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/) JVM.
Preliminary tests with OpenJ9 exhibit a 3x reduction in startup time, a 40% reduction in memory
footprint, and a 3x reduction in p99 latency. You can find a Linkerd+OpenJ9 Docker image at
`buoyantio/linkerd:1.4.5-openj9-experimental` on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/buoyantio/linkerd/tags/).

Full release notes:

* Add an OpenJ9 configuration for building a Docker image with the OpenJ9 JVM
* Fix a NullPointerException when using the -validate flag
* Fix an error where diagnostic tracing did not work when receiving a chunk encoded response
* Admin
  * Add a `security` section to the admin config that controls which admin endpoints are enabled
* HTTP/2
  * Fix a memory leak when there are a large number of reset streams
  * Allow HTTP/2 response classifiers to be loaded as plugins
* Namerd
  * Fix a memory leak in the io.l5d.mesh interpreter when idle services are reaped

## 1.4.4 2018-07-06

Linkerd 1.4.4 continues our focus on diagnostics, performance, and stability. This release features 
several performance and diagnostics improvements, including better handling of HTTP/2 edge cases, 
new watch state introspection for the Consul namer, and better isolation of admin page serving from 
the primary data path. It also features a new, pluggable trace propagation module that allows for 
easier integration with tracing systems like OpenTracing.

This release features contributions from Salesforce, Walmart, WePay, Comcast, ScalaConsultants, 
OfferUp, Buoyant, and more. A big thank you to:

* [Chris Goffinet](https://github.com/chrisgoffinet)
* [Dan Vulpe](https://github.com/dvulpe)
* [Ivano Pagano](https://github.com/ivanopagano)
* [Leo Liang](https://github.com/leozc)
* [Mantas Sto≈°kus](https://github.com/mstoskus)
* [Mohsen Rezaei](https://github.com/mrezaei00) 
* [Nick K](https://github.com/utrack)
* [Priyasmita Bagchi](https://github.com/pbagchi)
* [Robert Panzer](https://github.com/robertpanzer)
* [Ryan Michela](https://github.com/rmichela)
 
Full release notes:

* Distributed Tracing
  * Refactor Linkerd's trace propagation module to be pluggable. This allows better integration with
   tracing systems like OpenTracing and allows users to write Linkerd trace propagation plugins for 
   arbitrary tracing systems.
* TLS
  * Deprecate the  `trustCerts` config field in the client TLS section in favor of 
  `trustCertsBundle`. This allows you to use multiple trust certs in one file and avoids the need 
  for Linkerd to create temporary files.
* HTTP, HTTP/2
  * Fix an issue where Linkerd sometimes interprets HTTP/1.0 response with no Content-Length as a 
  chunked response.
  * Improve error messages by adding contextual routing information to a `ConnectionFailed` 
  exception sent back to a client via Linkerd.
  * Add a gRPC standard-compliant response classifier.
  * Fix an issue where Linkerd doesn't add an `l5d-err` header in an HTTP/2 response.
  * Fix an issue where Linkerd does not handle HTTP/2 requests with invalid HTTP status codes 
  correctly.
* Consul
  * Add new watch state instrumentation feature to the `io.l5d.consul` namer.
  * Fix an issue where the `io.l5d.consul` namer sometimes does not retry `ConnectionRefused` 
  exception.
  * Fix an issue where the `io.l5d.consul` namer returns a single IP for a service node instead of
   multiple IP addresses for a service node.
* Admin
  * Fix an issue where Linkerd may slow down data plane requests when the admin server is under 
  heavy load.
  * Improve performance of the Prometheus telemeter when serving metrics for a high cardinality 
  of services.
  * Fix an issue where the `intepreter_state` endpoint was not available for interpreters that 
  contained a transformer.
  * Fix the `namer_state` endpoint to expose namers that use transformers.
* Namerd
  * Fix an issue where null values were accepted by the Dtab HTTP API.

## 1.4.3 2018-06-12

This is a follow up release that includes diagnostic tracing for H2 requests.

Full release notes:

* Add diagnostic tracing for H2 requests, allowing Linkerd to add h2 request routing information at
the end of h2 streams to downstream services.
* Pass stack params to announcer plugins, allowing them to report metrics correctly. 

## 1.4.2 2018-06-11

Linkerd 1.4.2 continues its focus on diagnostics and stability. This release introduces Diagnostic 
Tracing, a feature that helps describe how Linkerd routes requests by displaying detailed routing 
information from each hop through your application. Stay tuned for a deep dive blog post about this 
feature coming soon. 

We‚Äôre also excited to share improvements to Linkerd‚Äôs error handling. Previously, when Linkerd 
failed to route a request, it could fail with a notoriously confusing `No Hosts Available` error. 
Now, these errors include more useful, informative diagnostic information to help explain the cause 
of the failure.

Full release notes:

* Diagnostics
   * Improve error reporting when receiving `No Hosts Available` exception.  Linkerd returns a less cryptic user-friendly message that includes information such as alternative service name resolutions and dtabs used for name resolution.
   * Add a new diagnostic tracing feature. It allows Linkerd to add routing information to the response of a `TRACE` request forwarded to a service.
* Fixes an issue where underscores in match patterns of `io.l5d.rewrite` no longer work.

## 1.4.1 2018-05-25

Linkerd 1.4.1 is focused on adding diagnostics and improved behavior in
production environments.

This release features contributions from Strava, Signal, OfferUp, Scalac,
Salesforce, and Buoyant.  A big thank you to:

* [Alex Leong](https://github.com/adleong/)
* [Dan Vulpe](https://github.com/dvulpe)
* [Dennis Adjei](https://github.com/dadjeibaah)
* [J Evans](https://github.com/jayeve)
* [Justin Venus](https://github.com/JustinVenus)
* [Leo Liang](https://github.com/leozc)
* [Matthew Huxtable](https://github.com/mhuxtable)
* [Micha≈Ç Mro≈ºek](https://github.com/mmrozek)
* [Peter Fich](https://github.com/peterfich)
* [Robert Panzer](https://github.com/robertpanzer)
* [Shakti Das](https://github.com/shakti-das)

Full release notes:

* Diagnostics:
  * Add watch state admin endpoints where you can inspect the current state of Linkerd's watches, including information such as time of last update and last known value.  These can be extremely valuable for debugging communication between Linkerd and other components such as Namerd or Kubernetes.
    * Kubernetes namer watch state: `/namer_state/io.l5d.k8s.json`
    * Namerd interpreter watch state: `/interpreter_state/io.l5d.namerd/<namespace>.json`
    * Namerd mesh interpreter watch state: `/interpreter_state/io.l5d.mesh/<root>.json`
* TLS:
  * Add the `intermediateCertsPath` config setting to client and server TLS.  This allows you to specify a file containing intermediate CA certificates supporting the main certificate.
  * Allow the TLS protocols to be configured which enables the ability to use TLSv1.2 specific ciphers.
* HTTP, HTTP/2:
  * Avoiding upgrading HTTP/1.0 requests to HTTP/1.1.  This prevents servers from sending responses that the client cannot handle (e.g. chunk encoded responses).
  * Fix a bug where Linkerd was not writing the `l5d-ctx-*` headers on HTTP/2 requests..
  * Add support for adding a 'Forwarded' header to HTTP/2 requests.
* Make Linkerd and Namerd honor the shutdown grace period when using the `/admin/shutdown` endpoint.
* Pass stack params to announcer plugins, allowing them to report metrics correctly.
* Add support for extracting substrings in path patterns.  This allows you to, for example, configure TLS commonNames based on substrings of a path segment instead of the entire segment.
* Add a TTL to Namerd's inactive cache so that Namerd will tear down watches on idle services.
* Improve fallback behavior in the io.l5d.marathon namer so that fallback occurs if an app has no replicas.
* Fix an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ForwardClientCertFilter.

## 1.4.0 2018-04-30

Linkerd 1.4.0 upgrades us to the latest versions of Finagle and Netty and
features lower memory usage for large payloads. Two new configuration options
have been introduced: client connection lifetimes and access log rotation
policy. One breaking change has been introduced around the configuration file
syntax for loggers.  This release features contributions from ThreeComma,
[ScalaConsultants](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants), [Salesforce](https://github.com/salesforce), and [Buoyant](https://github.com/buoyantio).

* **Breaking Change**: Rename the loggers section of the Linkerd config to requestAuthorizers to match the name of the plugin type ([#1900](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1900))
* Tune Netty/Finagle settings to reduce direct memory usage ([#1889](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1889)). This should dramatically reduce direct memory usage when transferring large payloads.
* Introduce a ClientSession configuration section that provides ways to control client connection lifetime ([#1903](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1903)).
* Expose rotation policy configuration for http and http2 access logs ([#1893](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1893)).
* Stop logging harmless reader discarded errors in k8s namer ([#1901](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1901)).
* Disable autoloading of the default tracer in Namerd ([#1902](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1902)). This prevents Namerd from attempting to connect to a Zipkin collector that doesn't exist.
* Upgrade to Finagle 18.4.0.

## 1.3.7 2018-04-5

Linkerd 1.3.7 includes memory leak fixes, tons of improvements for Consul, and more!  This release features contributions from ThreeComma, [NCBI](https://github.com/ncbi), WePay, [Salesforce](https://github.com/salesforce), [Homeaway](https://github.com/homeaway), Prosoft, and [Buoyant](https://github.com/buoyantio).

* Add support for more types of client certificates in the ForwardClientCertFilter ([#1850](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1850)).
* Improve documentation on how to override the base Docker image ([#1867](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1867)).
* Improve the efficientcy of the dtab delegator UI ([#1862](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1862)).

    to determine if the response was successful and if it should be retried.
    See [the docs](https://linkerd.io/config/1.1.3/linkerd/index.html#grpc-response-classifiers) for details.
  * Added support for failure accrual and automatic retries to HTTP/2.
  * Fixed a memory leak related to messages with only a headers frame.

* HTTP 1.1 protocol fixes for chunked transfer encoding and `Content-Length`.
* Improved memory allocation in InfluxDb and Prometheus telemeters.
* Documentation fixes.

## 1.1.1 2017-07-10

This is a big release with lots of fun stuff inside.

We've added some new features!
* Linkerd now features integration with Istio! (Beta.) This is a big feature. Blog post coming soon.
* We've introduced a new request logger plugin interface, for plugins that take an action (such as logging) on each request. This is currently used by the Istio plugin to report metadata about each request.

We‚Äôve fixed some things!
* We fixed a connection leak in HTTP/2 by properly multiplexing streams over a single connection.
* The configured failure accrual backoff parameter was being ignored. Now it's not!
* We fixed a TLS issue when no trust certs were specified.  As a result, using TLS with egress now works again.
* We fixed an exception when a Kubernetes Service's `targetPort` value is returned as a name instead of a number.
* The admin dashboard now displays server connections, standardizing client and server displays.

We‚Äôve made some internal changes to keep up with the latest and greatest:
* Netty4 is now the default engine for HTTP.
* We‚Äôve upgrade to Finagle 6.45 under the hood.

  thrift protocol upgrade should be attempted.

## 0.2.0

* This release contains **breaking changes** to the configuration file format.

  in the following ways:
  * Router configuration options can no longer be specified globally at the
    root level of the config file, but must be specified per-router.
