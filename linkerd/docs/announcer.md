# Announcers

An announcer registers servers in service discovery.  Each server may specify
a list of concrete names to announce as in the [announce](#announce)
server key.  Each announcer has a prefix and will only announce names that
begin with that prefix.


<aside class="notice">
These parameters are available to the announcer regardless of kind. Announcers may also have kind-specific parameters.
