# Namers

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.fs
  prefix: /disco
  rootDir: disco
```

A namer binds a [concrete name to a physical address](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Names.html).

<aside class="notice">
These parameters are available to the namer regardless of kind. Namers may also have kind-specific parameters.
</aside>

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
kind | _required_ | Either `io.l5d.fs`, `io.l5d.serversets`, `io.l5d.consul`, `io.l5d.k8s`, `io.l5d.marathon`, or `io.l5d.zkLeader`.
prefix | namer dependent | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
experimental | `false` | Set this to `true` to enable the namer if it is experimental.

<a name="fs"></a>
## File-based service discovery

kind: `io.l5d.fs`

### File-based Configuration

> Example fs configuration:

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.fs
  rootDir: disco
```

> Then reference the namer in the dtab to use it:

```
baseDtab: |
  /http/1.1/* => /#/io.l5d.fs
```

> With the filesystem directory:

```bash
$ ls disco/
apps    users   web
```

> The contents of the files look similar to this:

```bash
$ cat config/web
192.0.2.220 8080
192.0.2.105 8080
192.0.2.210 8080
```

linkerd ships with a simple file-based service discovery mechanism, called the
*file-based namer*. This system is intended to act as a structured form of
basic host lists.

While simple, the file-based namer is a full-fledged service discovery system,
and can be useful in production systems where host configurations are largely
static. It can act as an upgrade path for the introduction of an external
service discovery system, since application code will be isolated from these
changes. Finally, when chained with precedence rules, the file-based namer can
be a convenient way to add local service discovery overrides for debugging or
experimentation.

This service discovery mechanism is tied to the directory set by the
`namers/rootDir` key in `config.yaml`. This directory must be on the local
filesystem and relative to linkerd's start path. Every file in this directory
corresponds to a service, where the name of the file is the service's _concrete
name_, and the contents of the file must be a newline-delimited set of
addresses.

linkerd watches all files in this directory, so files can be added, removed, or
updated, and linkerd will pick up the changes automatically.

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.fs` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
rootDir | _required_ | the directory containing name files as described above.

### File-based Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format:

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<fileName>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells linkerd to resolve the request path using the fs namer.
fileName | yes | The file in `rootDir` to use when resolving this request.

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.consul` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
experimental | _required_ | Because this namer is still considered experimental, you must set this to `true` to use it.

includeTag | `false` | If `true`, read a Consul tag from the path.
useHealthCheck | `false` | If `true`, rely on Consul health checks.
token | no authentication | The auth token to use when making API calls.
setHost | `false` | If `true`, HTTP requests resolved by Consul will have their Host header overwritten to `${serviceName}.service.${datacenter}.${domain}`. `$domain` is fetched from Consul.

### Consul Path Parameters

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<datacenter>/<serviceName>
```

> Dtab Path Format when includeTag is true

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<datacenter>/<tag>/<serviceName>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells linkerd to resolve the request path using the consul namer.
