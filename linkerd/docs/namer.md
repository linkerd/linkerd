## File-based service discovery

kind: `io.l5d.fs`

### File-based Configuration

> Example fs configuration:

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.fs
  rootDir: disco
```

> Then reference the namer in the dtab to use it:

```yaml
dtab: |
  /svc => /#/io.l5d.fs
```

> With the filesystem directory:

```bash
$ ls disco/
apps    users   web
```

> The contents of the files look similar to this:

```bash
$ cat config/web
192.0.2.220 8080
192.0.2.105 8080
192.0.2.210 8080 * 2.0
```

<aside class="warning">
Due to the implementation of file watches in Java, this namer consumes a high
amount of CPU and is not suitable for production use.
</aside>

Linkerd ships with a simple file-based service discovery mechanism called the
*file-based namer*. This system is intended to act as a structured form of
basic host lists.

While simple, the file-based namer is a full-fledged service discovery system,
and can be useful in production systems where host configurations are largely
static. It can act as an upgrade path for the introduction of an external
service discovery system, since application code will be isolated from these
changes. Finally, when chained with precedence rules, the file-based namer can
be a convenient way to add local service discovery overrides for debugging or
experimentation.

This service discovery mechanism is tied to the directory set by the
`namers/rootDir` key in `config.yaml`. This directory must be on the local
filesystem and relative to Linkerd's start path. Every file in this directory
corresponds to a service, where the name of the file is the service's _concrete
name_, and the contents of the file must be a newline-delimited set of
addresses.

Linkerd watches all files in this directory, so files can be added, removed, or
updated, and Linkerd will pick up the changes automatically.

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.fs` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
rootDir | _required_ | the directory containing name files as described above.

### File-based Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format:

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<fileName>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells Linkerd to resolve the request path using the fs namer.
fileName | yes | The file in `rootDir` to use when resolving this request.

### Consul Configuration

> Configure a consul namer:

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.consul
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 2181
  includeTag: true
  useHealthCheck: false
  healthStatuses:
    - "passing"
    - "warning"
  setHost: true
  consistencyMode: stale
```

> Then reference the namer in the dtab to use it:

```yaml
dtab: |
  /svc => /#/io.l5d.consul/dc1/prod;
```

> Optionally, define node weight using tags:

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.consul
  weights:
   - tag: experimental
     weight: 0.1
   - tag: primary
     weight: 5.0
```

Linkerd provides support for service discovery via [Consul](https://www.consul.io/). 

The internal state of the Consul namer can be viewed at the
admin endpoint: `/namer_state/<prefix>.json`.

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.consul` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
host | `localhost` | The Consul host.
port | `8500` | The Consul port.
includeTag | `false` | If `true`, read a Consul tag from the path.
useHealthCheck | `false` | If `true`, exclude app instances that do not match one of the provided `healthStatuses`. Even if `false`, Linkerd's built-in resiliency algorithms will still apply.
healthStatuses | `passing` | List of statuses to used to filter Consul app instances by. Possible values are `passing`, `warning`, `critical`, `maintenance`. Note that if a service defines more than one health check per app instance then the most representative statuses is used (`maintenance` > `critical` > `warning` > `passing`). If `useHealthCheck` is `false` then this parameter has no effect. Regardless of the statuses used to filter, Linkerd's built-in resiliency algorithms will still apply.
token | no authentication | The auth token to use when making API calls.
setHost | `false` | If `true`, HTTP requests resolved by Consul will have their Host header overwritten to `${serviceName}.service.${datacenter}.${domain}`. `$domain` is fetched from Consul.
consistencyMode | `default` | Select between [Consul API consistency modes](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html) such as `default`, `stale` and `consistent`.
failFast | `false` | If `false`, disable fail fast and failure accrual for Consul client. Keep it `false` when using a local agent but change it to `true` when talking directly to an HA Consul API.
preferServiceAddress | `true` | If `true` use the service address if defined and default to the node address. If `false` always use the node address.
weights | none | List of tag-weight configurations, for adjusting the weights of node addresses. When a node matches more than one tag, it gets the highest matching weight. In the absence of match or configuration, nodes get a default weight of `1.0`.
tls | no tls | Use TLS during connection with Consul. see [Consul Encryption](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html) and [TLS](#consul-tls).

### Consul Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format when includeTag is false

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<datacenter>/<serviceName>
```

> Dtab Path Format when includeTag is true

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<datacenter>/<tag>/<serviceName>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells Linkerd to resolve the request path using the consul namer.
datacenter | yes | The Consul datacenter to use for this request. It can have a value `.local` (otherwise invalid datacenter name from Consul's perspective) in order to reference a datacenter of the agent namer is connected to.
tag | yes if includeTag is `true` | The Consul tag to use for this request.
serviceName | yes | The Consul service name to use for this request.

### Consul TLS

>Linkerd supports encrypted communication via TLS to Consul.

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.consul
  host: localhost
  port: 8500
  tls:
    disableValidation: false
    commonName: consul.io
    trustCertsBundle: /certificates/cacert.pem
    clientAuth:
      certPath: /certificates/cert.pem
      keyPath: /certificates/key.pem
```

A TLS object describes how Linkerd should use TLS when sending requests to Consul agent.

Key               | Default Value                              | Description
----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -----------
disableValidation | false                                      | Enable this to skip hostname validation (unsafe). Setting `disableValidation: true` is incompatible with `clientAuth`.
commonName        | _required_ unless disableValidation is set | The common name to use for all TLS requests.
trustCerts        | empty list                                 | A list of file paths of CA certs to use for common name validation (deprecated, please use trustCertsBundle).
trustCertsBundle  | empty                                      | A file path of CA certs bundle to use for common name validation.
clientAuth        | none                                       | A client auth object used to sign requests.

If present, a clientAuth object must contain two properties:

Key      | Default Value | Description
---------|---------------|-------------
certPath | _required_    | File path to the TLS certificate file.
keyPath  | _required_    | File path to the TLS key file.  Must be in PKCS#8 format.

<aside class="warning">
Setting `disableValidation: true` will force the use of the JDK SSL provider which does not support client auth. Therefore, `disableValidation: true` and `clientAuth` are incompatible.

  ttlMs:          5000
  useHealthCheck: false
```
> Then reference the namer in the dtab to use it:

```yaml
dtab: |
  /marathonId => /#/io.l5d.marathon;
  /host       => /$/io.buoyant.http.domainToPathPfx/marathonId;
  /svc => /host;
```

Linkerd provides support for service discovery via
[Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/).

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.marathon` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
host | `marathon.mesos` | The Marathon master host.
port | `80` | The Marathon master port.
uriPrefix | none | The Marathon API prefix. This prefix depends on your Marathon configuration. For example, running Marathon locally, the API is available at `localhost:8080/v2/`, while the default setup on AWS/DCOS is `$(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/marathon/v2/apps`.
ttlMs | `5000` | The polling interval in milliseconds against the Marathon API.
useHealthCheck | `false` | If `true`, exclude app instances that are failing Marathon health checks. Even if `false`, Linkerd's built-in resiliency algorithms will still apply.
tls | no tls | The Marathon namer will make requests to Marathon/DCOS using TLS if this parameter is provided. This is useful when DC/OS is run in [strict](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/security/#security-modes) security mode. It must be a [client TLS](#client-tls) object. Note that the `clientAuth` config value will be unused, as DC/OS does not use mutual TLS.

### Marathon Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<appId>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells Linkerd to resolve the request path using the marathon namer.
appId | yes | The app id of a marathon application. This id can be multiple path segments long. For example, the app with id "/users" can be reached with `/#/io.l5d.marathon/users`. Likewise, the app with id "/appgroup/usergroup/users" can be reached with `/#/io.l5d.marathon/appgroup/usergroup/users`.

### Marathon Authentication

> Example DCOS environment variable

```json
{
  "login_endpoint": "https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login",
  "private_key": "<private-key-value>",
  "scheme": "RS256",
  "uid": "service-acct"
}
```

> Example basic HTTP authentication variable

```bash
dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

The Marathon namer supports loading authentication data from an environment variable for DCOS private key in the `DCOS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL` variable and standalone Marathon basic HTTP authentication in the `MARATHON_HTTP_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` environment variable. If both are provided the `DCOS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL` takes precedence.

Basic authentication token is base64 encoded and should not include the `Basic` prefix, only in the format `username:password`.

linkerd provides support for service discovery via Rancher's [Metadata-API](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/rancher-services/metadata-service/).

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
prefix | `io.l5d.rancher` | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
experimental | `false` | Since the Rancher namer is still considered experimental, this must be set to `true`.
portMappings | `<empty map>` | If specified, you can use the names of these port-mappings for the `<port>` path parameter. By default, the namer knows `http` and `https`.
maxWait | 30 | The max number of seconds to wait for changes in the Rancher Metadata-API before starting a new request.

### Rancher Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/#/<prefix>/<port>/<stack>/<service>
```

Key | Required | Description
--- | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes | Tells linkerd to resolve the request path using the Rancher namer.
port | yes | The port name or number to route the request to
stack | yes | Name of the stack of the service
service | yes | The name of the service

## Rewrite

kind: `io.l5d.rewrite`

### Rewrite Configuration

> Example rewrite configuration:

```yaml
namers:
- kind: io.l5d.rewrite
  prefix: /rewrite
  pattern: "/{service}/api"
  name: "/srv/{service}"
```

> Then reference the namer in the dtab to use it:

```yaml
dtab: |
  /svc => /#/rewrite
```

A namer that completely rewrites a path.  This is useful for doing arbitrary
reordering of the path segments that is not possible using standard prefix
replacement. In addition to reordering path segments, this tool can be used
to modify or split individual segments using regex capture groups.

If the name matches the pattern in the config, it will be replaced by the
name in the config.  Additionally, any variables in the pattern will capture
the value of the matching path segment and may be used in the final name.

Note: Pattern matches are greedy.  For example patterns like "{foo}{bar}"
are ambiguous.  With the capture implementation, {foo} would capture the
whole segment and {bar} would be empty. Similarly, the pattern "{foo}-{bar}"
on the segment "a-b-c" would capture "a-b" into foo and "c" into bar.

Key     | Default Value    | Description
------- | ---------------- | -----------
prefix  | _required_       | Resolves names with `/#/<prefix>`.
pattern | _required_       | If the name matches this prefix, replace it with the name configured in the `name` parameter.  Wildcards and variable capture are allowed (see: `io.buoyant.namer.util.PathMatcher`).
name    | _required_       | The replacement name.  Variables captured in the pattern may be used in this string.

### Rewrite Path Parameters

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/#/<prefix> [/ *name ]
```

Key    | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----------
prefix | yes      | Tells Linkerd to resolve the request path using the rewrite namer.
name   | yes      | Attempt to match this name against the pattern and replace it with the configured name.

## Built-In Namers

The following namers are always available to be used in dtabs. They are prefixed with `/$/` instead
of `/#/`, and can be used without explicitly adding them to the
[`namers`](#namers-and-service-discovery) section of the config.

### inet

The inet namer does a DNS lookup for the given hostname and uses the given port.

```
/$/inet/<hostname>/<port>
```

### io.buoyant.rinet

The rinet namer is like the inet namer but takes the hostname and port arguments in the reverse
order.  This is often easier to work with than the inet namer because dtabs can only make prefix
substitutions and we often wish to use a fixed port while varying the hostname.

```
/$/io.buoyant.rinet/<port>/<hostname>
```

## Rewriting Namers

In addition to service discovery namers, Linkerd supplies a number of utility
namers. These namers assist in path rewriting when the transformation is more
complicated than just prefix substitution. They are prefixed with `/$/` instead
of `/#/`, and can be used without explicitly adding them to the
[`namers`](#namers-and-service-discovery) section of the config.

### domainToPathPfx

```
/marathonId => /#/io.l5d.marathon;
/host       => /$/io.buoyant.http.domainToPathPfx/marathonId;
/svc => /host;
```

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/$/io.buoyant.http.domainToPathPfx/<prefix>/<host>
```

Rewrites the path's prefix with `<prefix>` first, followed by each subdomain of
`<host>` separated and in reverse order.

For example,
`/$/io.buoyant.http.domainToPathPfx/pfx/foo.buoyant.io/resource/name` would be
rewritten to `/pfx/io/buoyant/foo/resource/name`.

### subdomainOfPfx

```
/consulSvc  => /#/io.l5d.consul/.local
/host       => /$/io.buoyant.http.subdomainOfPfx/service.consul/consulSvc;
/svc => /host;
```

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/$/io.buoyant.http.subdomainOfPfx/<domain>/<prefix>/<host>
```

Rewrites the path's prefix with `<prefix>` first, followed by `<host>` with the
`<domain>` dropped.

For example,
`/$/io.buoyant.http.subdomainOfPfx/buoyant.io/pfx/foo.buoyant.io/resource/name`
would be rewritten to `/pfx/foo/resource/name`

### hostportPfx

```
/ip-hostport => /$/inet;
/svc         => /$/io.buoyant.hostportPfx/ip-hostport;
```

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/$/io.buoyant.hostportPfx/<prefix>/<host>:<port>/etc
```

Rewrites a name of the form "host:port" as a path with the port followed by the host. Does
not support IPv6 host IPs (because IPv6 notation doesn't work in Paths as-is
due to bracket characters).

For example,
`/$/io.buoyant.hostportPfx/pfx/host:port/etc`
would be rewritten to `/pfx/host/port/etc`.

### porthostPfx

```
/k8s-porthost => /#/io.l5d.k8s/default;
/svc          => /$/io.buoyant.porthostPfx/k8s-porthost;
```

> Dtab Path Format

```yaml
/$/io.buoyant.porthostPfx/<prefix>/<host>:<port>/etc
```

Rewrites a name of the form "host:port" as a path with the port followed by the host. Does
not support IPv6 host IPs (because IPv6 notation doesn't work in Paths as-is
due to bracket characters).

For example,
`/$/io.buoyant.porthostPfx/pfx/host:port/etc`
would be rewritten to `/pfx/port/host/etc`.
