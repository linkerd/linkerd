# Tracers

Requests that are routed by linkerd are also traceable using Finagle's built-in
tracing instrumentation.

<aside class="notice">
These parameters are available to the tracer regardless of kind. Tracers may also have kind-specific parameters.
</aside>

Key | Default Value | Description
--- | ------------- | -----------
kind | _required_ | Only `io.l5d.zipkin` is available at this time.
debugTrace | `false` | If `true`, print all traces to the console. Note this overrides the global `-com.twitter.finagle.tracing.debugTrace` flag, and will default to that flag if not set here.


## Zipkin

- kind: io.l5d.zipkin
  host: localhost
  port: 9410
  sampleRate: 0.02

kind: `io.l5d.zipkin`
