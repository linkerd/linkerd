:balloon: Welcome to Linkerd! :wave:

Linkerd is a transparent *service mesh*, designed to make modern applications
safe and sane by transparently adding service discovery, load balancing, failure
handling, instrumentation, and routing to all inter-service communication.

Linkerd (pronounced "linker-DEE") acts as a transparent HTTP/gRPC/thrift/etc
proxy, and can usually be dropped into existing applications with a minimum of
configuration, regardless of what language they're written in. It works with
many common protocols and service discovery backends, including scheduled
environments like Mesos and Kubernetes.

Linkerd is built on top of [Netty][netty] and [Finagle][finagle], a
production-tested RPC framework used by high-traffic companies like Twitter,
Pinterest, Tumblr, PagerDuty, and others.

Linkerd is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF][cncf]).

## Want to try it? ##

We distribute binaries which you can download from the [Linkerd releases
page][releases]. We also publish Docker images for each release, which you can
find on [Docker Hub][docker].

For instructions on how to configure and run Linkerd, see the [user
documentation on linkerd.io](https://linkerd.io).

## Working in this repo ##

[BUILD.md](BUILD.md) includes general information on how to work in this repo.
Additionally, there are documents on how to build several of the application
subprojects:

* [linkerd](linkerd/README.md) -- produces `linkerd` router artifacts
* [namerd](namerd/README.md) -- produces `namerd` service discovery artifacts
* [grpc](grpc/README.md) -- produces the `protoc-gen-io.buoyant.grpc` code generator

We :heart: pull requests! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on
contributing changes.
